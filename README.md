# Project_D15
Formula 1 Winners Prediction Over Seven Decades.


## Goal: The aim of this project is to create a model capable of predicting the Formula 1 winner across seven different decades. PLEASE NOTE! The project goal has changed in the meantime. ##

All data processing scripts, namely "relations.py," "data_cleaning.py," and "data_separation.py," are provided. Follow these steps:

1. Open/load "relations.py," resulting in the creation of the "all_constructors.csv" file.
2. Execute the code in "data_cleaning.py," resulting in the cleaned dataset named "clean_data.csv."
3. After that, run "data_separation.py," which divides the data into decades.
If you prefer not to go through this process, pre-processed datasets named "cleaned_data_period_1-10.csv" are also available.
